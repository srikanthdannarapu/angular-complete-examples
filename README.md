Outbox Scheduler Implementation Notes
Overview
The Outbox Scheduler is responsible for managing the execution of various processes related to the Outbox pattern. It allows stopping both the Near Real-Time (NRT) Consumer and the Event Entity Consumer based on the stop flag in the database. This feature is designed to facilitate application control during deployment and other activities as needed.

Implementation Steps
1. Create a New Outbox Scheduler
Develop a new scheduler that runs at a pre-configured interval.
This scheduler will handle the logic to stop both the NRT Consumer and the Event Entity Consumer based on the stop flag status in the database.
2. Inject ConfigurableEnvironment
Inject the ConfigurableEnvironment object into the newly created scheduler to access application configuration properties.
3. Modify Configuration Property
Locate the property outbox.scheduler.enabled in the application configuration.
Set the property as follows based on the stop flag status:
Set to "true" if the stop flag is disabled, indicating that the application should continue running.
Set to "false" if the stop flag is enabled, indicating that the application should be stopped.
Changes in mastercard.outbox.binder.core Library
The following changes are required in the mastercard.outbox.binder.core library to ensure the conditional execution of the Outbox Schedulers:

OutboxMessageProcessor: Update the scheduler to run conditionally based on the value of outbox.scheduler.enabled.

OutboxMessagePurger: Update the scheduler to run conditionally based on the value of outbox.scheduler.enabled.

OutboxMessageReProcessor: Update the scheduler to run conditionally based on the value of outbox.scheduler.enabled.

Additional Notes
Ensure that the Outbox Scheduler is properly tested in various scenarios, including enabling and disabling the stop flag.
Consider implementing appropriate error handling and logging to provide visibility into the scheduler's behavior.
Conclusion
The Outbox Scheduler enhances the application's control and management during deployment and other activities by allowing the dynamic stopping of key components based on the stop flag status in the database.

Feel free to copy and paste this template into your Confluence page and customize it further to match your organization's documentation style and formatting preferences. Don't forget to include any relevant diagrams, code snippets, or additional details that might be important for your team to understand and implement the Outbox Scheduler effectively.
