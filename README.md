Implementation Approach for Adding a Switch Column (FEATURE) or Listener-Specific Columns (NRT_LISTENER, ENTITY_EVENT_LISTENER) in Oracle Table

1. Adding a Switch Column (FEATURE):

Pros:

Simplicity: Adding a single column for the switch reduces complexity. You have a single point of control for stopping events.
Flexibility: You can easily extend the list of features without modifying the table structure.
Centralized Control: Switching off/on all features at once is straightforward.
Ease of Maintenance: You don't need to alter the table structure for new features; only update values.
Cons:

Limited Context: A single column might lack context if more granular control is needed for specific listeners in the future.
Duplication of Logic: If different listeners require different control behaviors, the logic might become convoluted.
2. Adding Listener-Specific Columns (NRT_LISTENER, ENTITY_EVENT_LISTENER):

Pros:

Granular Control: Each listener has its own dedicated switch, allowing precise control over individual listeners.
Clear Intent: Column names reflect the listeners, making the purpose explicit.
Scalability: As new listeners are added, new columns can be introduced without affecting existing logic.
Cons:

Table Structure Changes: Adding new columns means altering the table structure, which can be complex and require maintenance windows.
Management Overhead: With more columns, the table becomes wider, which might impact performance and requires more careful management.
Query Complexity: Querying might involve checking multiple columns for status, potentially making queries more complex.
Recommendation:

Considering the provided information, it's recommended to start with the Switch Column (FEATURE) approach due to its simplicity and flexibility. However, for better future-proofing and more precise control over individual listeners, consider the following strategies:

1. Hybrid Approach:

Begin with the FEATURE column to handle overall switch functionality.
If listener-specific control becomes necessary in the future, consider creating a separate table to store listener statuses. This table can be linked to the main table via foreign keys, allowing for more complex control while minimizing table structure changes.
2. Proper Naming Conventions:

If you choose the FEATURE column, make sure to use clear and comprehensive values that can encompass potential future features. For example, use "ALL" for stopping all listeners, "PAN_REFRESH" for the respective listener, and similarly for other features.
3. Documentation:

Regardless of the approach chosen, maintain thorough documentation to explain the purpose and usage of the chosen column(s) to avoid confusion for future developers and maintainers.
Remember that the choice between simplicity and granularity depends on your specific use case and potential future requirements. It's important to consider the trade-offs between table structure changes, query complexity, and the level of control needed for the listeners.
